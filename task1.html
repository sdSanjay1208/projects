    <p>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves various aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. Web development can be divided into two main categories: frontend development and backend development.</p>
    <p>Frontend development is the part of web development that deals with the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the structure, style, and functionality of the web page. Frontend developers also use frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap, React, and Angular to enhance the features and performance of the web page.</p>
